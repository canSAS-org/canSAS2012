	This document is under construction.

In some cases storing small volumnes of  small-angle scattering data
in text files formatted as XML (http://www.w3schools.com/xml) may be 
reasonable.
For all general applications, see the chapter on the recommoneded 
container format titled 
:ref:`hdf5_implementation`.

The basic plan here is to describe the implementation of the canSAS 
multi-dimensional format in an XML file by creating an :index:`XML Schema` 
file (http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema, http://www.w3schools.com/schema) 
or similar schema specification 
(such as :index:`schematron` - http://www.schematron.com).  

The effort to create this XML Schema specification will commence once 
the basics of the canSAS multi-dimensional format are set forth.
