	This document is under construction.
	Many parts have yet to be written.

It is expected that small-angle scattering data will be stored in 
text files formatted as XML (http://www.w3schools.com/xml).  
To store SAS data in binary  files, see the chapter titled 
:ref:`hdf5_implementation`.

The basic plan here is to describe the implementation of the canSAS 
multi-dimensional format in an XML file by creating an :index:`XML Schema` 
file (http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema, http://www.w3schools.com/schema) 
or similar schema specification 
(such as :index:`schematron` - http://www.schematron.com).  

The effort to create this XML Schema specification will commence once 
the basics of the canSAS multi-dimensional format are set forth.
